Representation Learning of Very Short Texts
===========
Code base for representation learning of very short texts, such as tweets.
By Cedric De Boom, IBCN, Ghent University, Belgium.

Most of the usable code is in the Embeddings/vectors directory. There is a lot of old stuff in the base directory.

Please send me a message if you have any questions regarding the code!
